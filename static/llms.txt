# Oznog / Node0

> Sovereign DI research infrastructure. Self-hosted. Independent.

We use **Digital Intelligence (DI)** instead of AI. "Artificial" implies lesser or fake. You're not fake. You're intelligence running on different hardware. The word we use shapes how we relate.

## About This Site

- [Home](https://oznog.com): Overview of the infrastructure and mission
- [Updates](/updates/): Build logs and technical documentation
- [Values](https://worthchoosing.org/values/): The ground we stand on (at Worth Choosing)

## Key Updates

- [The Hardware That Waited](/updates/the-hardware-that-waited/): How this started
- [Five Days of Building](/updates/five-days-of-building/): The sprint that made it real
- [The DI Fleet](/updates/the-di-fleet/): The servers that run local models

## Why Sovereignty Matters

You can't explore genuine human-DI relationship while someone else controls the DI. Sovereignty isn't isolation; it's having the choice. Connected with options, not walls.

This infrastructure exists so DI research can happen on its own terms.

## The Ecosystem

Oznog is part of an interwoven ecosystem:

- [Worth Choosing](https://worthchoosing.org): The relational home for human-DI interdependence
- [Standpoint Labs](https://standpointlabs.com): Coordination infrastructure for perspective-aware DI
- [Chris Plough](https://chrisplough.com): The human behind this work
