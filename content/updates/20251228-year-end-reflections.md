As 2025 winds down, it's worth taking stock of where we are.

What started as a sketch on paper has evolved into a concrete plan with real momentum. We've defined our architecture, made our key technology bets, and begun the procurement process for our first node.

2026 is shaping up to be the year of execution. Hardware arrives in January. The build begins shortly after.

To everyone who's been following along: thank you. The best is yet to come.
