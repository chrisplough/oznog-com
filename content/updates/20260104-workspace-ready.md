Before the hardware arrives, the workspace needs to be ready.

Spent the weekend setting up proper workbenches, organizing tools, and ensuring we have adequate power and cooling for the initial build phase. Nothing glamorous, but essential groundwork.

ESD protection in place. Thermal paste at the ready. Cable management supplies stocked.

Now we wait for the delivery trucks.
