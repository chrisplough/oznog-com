Happy New Year! 2026 is here, and we're hitting the ground running.

The holiday break gave us time to refine our plans and prepare for the hardware that's on its way. Our first node components should arrive within the week.

This year's priorities:
- Get Node 0 fully operational
- Establish baseline performance benchmarks
- Document everything for the community

Let's build something great.
