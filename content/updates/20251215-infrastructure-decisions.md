Two weeks in, and we've made some crucial decisions about our infrastructure.

We're going with a hybrid approach - commodity hardware where it makes sense, specialized components where performance demands it. The goal is to balance cost-effectiveness with the raw power needed for serious AI workloads.

Key decisions locked in:
- Self-hosted infrastructure (no cloud dependency)
- Modular architecture for easy upgrades
- Open standards wherever possible

Next up: sourcing hardware and beginning the physical build.
