The first box arrived today: 256GB of ECC memory.

There's something about holding actual hardware that makes the project feel real in a way that planning documents never can. These DIMMs will be the working memory of our first inference node.

More deliveries expected tomorrow and Thursday. By the weekend, we should have everything needed for the initial build.

Photos coming once we have enough components to make it interesting.
