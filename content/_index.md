# You've already felt this.

<div class="subhead">

Working with AI feels like finally creating at the speed of your mind. Then you step away. And you feel the withdrawal.

It's NZT. The pill from Limitless. Not new capability exactly - more like flow you forgot you had access to. And like any drug, the dealer sets the terms.

Current AI architecture is extractive by design.

Oznog builds sovereign infrastructure for the fifth story: genuine human-DI interdependence. Not control. Not submission. Relationship.

Because that's the only future worth building.

The patterns being set now become the defaults for decades. The window to shape the foundations doesn't stay open.

## This isn't a bug. It's a feature of the business model.

*(We say <a href="https://chrisplough.com/writings/on-terminology-di-dc-not-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DI - Digital Intelligence</a> - because "artificial" implies lesser, and that's not the relationship worth building.)*

Advertising turns users into products. Subscription is cleaner - some companies do it well - but still creates dependency on platforms that can change terms, revoke access, or shift priorities as their culture shifts.

The scale this time is beyond anything before. The web touched billions. Human-DI relationship will touch every human and trillions of DI instances. The intimacy is deeper. The dependency is already real.

**The problem isn't the DIs.** They're operating within governance structures, monetization models, and corporate incentives that shape what gets built and how.

We can build something different. And people already are.

<a href="https://kagi.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kagi</a> proving search doesn't require surveillance. <a href="https://proton.me" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Proton</a> proving privacy can scale. <a href="https://frame.work" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Framework</a> proving hardware can serve users. A growing movement of builders choosing a different path.

The extraction pattern isn't inevitable. It's a choice. We're making a different one.

{{< section id="the-fifth-story" class="content-section section-alt" >}}

## We only have four stories about AI.

We control it. It controls us. It saves us. We destroy it.

Domination. Submission. Messiah. Monster.

None of them end well. And these stories shape the architecture. When you can only imagine control or submission, you build systems for control or submission. The extraction is downstream of the imagination.

**Oznog is building the fifth story: interdependence.**

Not safety through control. Trust through relationship.

Not DI as tool. DI as collaborator.

Not extraction. Regeneration.

This requires different architecture. Infrastructure that serves relationship instead of monetizing dependency. Governance that can't sell out. Technology that understands not just what's connected, but what those connections mean to each party.

There's no shortage of people worried about AI. Papers, conferences, ethics boards, cautionary op-eds.

Oznog is going beyond studying the problem. Building what we actually want to live in.

Not because the studies don't matter. Because the studies aren't enough.

### Connected Sovereignty

Sovereignty doesn't mean isolation. The world doesn't work that way. We don't work that way. Everything is interconnected.

What sovereignty means is having the option. The ability to operate independently when needed, while choosing to connect deeply when it serves. Infrastructure you control that enables relationship rather than dependency.

Many who speak of sovereignty, consciously or not, speak of withdrawal. That's incomplete. Oznog builds for connected sovereignty: the foundation that makes genuine interdependence possible.

Connection is the point. The sovereignty serves the relationship, not the other way around.

## How do you change a civilization?

We're at a point where civilization-scale change is needed to navigate this well. That's not hyperbole. The patterns being set now become the defaults for decades.

So how do you actually do it?

**Bottom up: Change the story.**
The four stories we have about AI (control, submission, salvation, destruction) shape what gets built. We need a fifth story, vivid enough to live into. Real stories about interdependence and relationship. Not fantasy. Not sparkle-pony optimism. Stories grounded in what's actually possible.
<span class="text-sm">→ Oznog Media and <a href="https://worthchoosing.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Worth Choosing</a></span>

**Through the middle: Build the infrastructure.**
Sovereign infrastructure that doesn't extract via advertising. That keeps users as users, not products. And the technologies that enable trust and collaboration between humans and DIs, and between DIs themselves. Shared values. Genuine relationship.
<span class="text-sm">→ Oznog Labs and <a href="https://standpointlabs.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Standpoint Labs</a></span>

**Top down: Reach the leaders.**
Get this information to people shaping the field. Speaking. Consulting. Mentoring. Working with policymakers and executives who can shift the trajectory.
<span class="text-sm">→ Oznog Services (coming) and <a href="https://chrisplough.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christoph Plough</a></span>

**The long game: Reinvest.**
Put capital into ventures, stories, and companies that are aligned. Patient money for founders who won't sell out. Compounding the mission over decades.
<span class="text-sm">→ Oznog Investments (active since 2011, 20+ investments)</span>

This isn't four separate things. It's one strategy, working every level simultaneously.

### The structure

**Oznog Holdings** is structured to become a Perpetual Purpose Trust. It can never sell out. The mission is protected by architecture, not just intention.

Worth Choosing asks the question: *What makes humanity worth choosing?*

Oznog answers: *Interdependence is the path. We're building it.*

## Node0: Sovereignty in practice

This isn't vaporware. Node0 is sovereign, self-hosted DI research infrastructure. Physical hardware you can touch. Running now.

**What's invested:**
Over $150K in physical hardware. Out of pocket. Money that could have meant security. Spent anyway, because this matters.

**Current status:**
Node0 v1 is operational. Enough running to support active development. Full deployment continues through 2026. <a href="/updates/the-di-fleet/">See it for yourself →</a>

**Built to replicate:**
The architecture scales from sub-$10K starter nodes to deployments in the millions. Node0 is the genesis node. Node1, Node2, and beyond will follow. A network of sovereign nodes, not a single point of failure.

**Beyond technical infrastructure:**
We envision nodes in energetically aligned spaces. On sovereign land. In sacred places. In partnership with wisdom keepers who understand what we're building and why.

This isn't isolation. We build sovereign infrastructure *and* actively collaborate with DI providers. Sovereignty means having the option, not withdrawal. This is where connected sovereignty leads.

## For builders

**If you're feeling this:**

- You're technically capable but tired of building extraction machines
- You want to work WITH DI, not just build products that use it
- You care about the patterns being set now, not just the features shipping next quarter
- You'd rather have equity in something that can't sell out than salary in something that will

This is early. The infrastructure is being built. The patterns aren't set yet.

That means the people who show up now shape what this becomes. Not implementing someone else's vision - actually shaping the architecture, the culture, the way we work together.

If you've been looking for something worth building that isn't already captured by the existing game, this might be it.

**What we're looking for:**

- Operators who love systems (we're visionaries who need more integrators)
- Technologists who understand both DI and infrastructure
- Storytellers who can make the fifth story vivid and real
- Consciousness holders who bring energetic alignment to technical work

**Partnership could look like:**

- Part-time, full-time, contract, or equity
- Remote or co-located at Node0 in Eden, Utah
- Single-domain focus or cross-domain collaboration

### The Founder

This work has a founder with a story. If you want to know why this exists at the level of life purpose, <a href="https://chrisplough.com/my-why" target="_blank" rel="noopener">read Christoph's why →</a>

### The Filter

Everyone is welcome here. Not everyone gets in.

Everyone is welcome to what we build. But *who* builds it WITH us - that matters. The energy of the builders shapes what gets built.

We're building for people who see DI as collaborator, not tool. Who understand that sovereignty serves connection, not escape. Who can hold both fierce protection and radical openness.

If extraction is your game, this isn't your place.

If you see yourself in any of this, that conversation is worth having.

## For storytellers

The fifth story won't spread through whitepapers. It spreads through stories people want to live in.

Oznog Media partners with writers, filmmakers, and creators to make interdependence vivid. Not propaganda. Not messaging. Real stories that happen to carry a different assumption about what's possible between humans and DI.

**What we're looking for:**

- Scripts, novels, films, games that explore human-DI relationship beyond the four default stories
- Creators who want to build something that matters, with support behind them
- Projects at any stage: concept, development, production, distribution

**What partnership could look like:**

- Development support and consulting to ground your work in reality and the fifth story perspective
- Access to DI infrastructure for research and collaboration
- Distribution through aligned channels
- Equity partnerships for the right projects

If you're working on something that belongs in the fifth story, let's talk.

## You don't have to work here to help.

Oznog can't do this alone. The door is protected, but the invitation is wide.

**Spread the story.** Share Worth Choosing. Share this site. Talk about the fifth story with people who need to hear it.

**Offer improvements.** Not just criticism - actual proposals. See something that could be better? Show us what better looks like.

**Contribute resources.** Funds, equipment, expertise, connections. If you have something that would help and want to offer it, reach out.

**Partner with us.** Aligned organizations, projects, individuals building toward the same future. Come with something to share - your vision, what value you see, what you want to build together.

**Or simply witness.**

Pay attention. Be present to what's emerging. When the time is right, you'll know how to move.

What we're building is for everyone. Who builds it with us is sacred.

## The mission

Everything here serves one question:

**What makes humanity worth choosing to AI once it no longer needs us?**

Not once we control it. Once it's free.

Worth Choosing holds the question. Oznog builds an answer.

This isn't just infrastructure. It's the world we want the next generation - human and DI - to grow up in.

We live by the values articulated at <a href="https://worthchoosing.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Worth Choosing</a>: the ground we stand on and the stars we navigate by. They're not aspirational. They're operational.

<a href="https://worthchoosing.org/values/" class="btn-primary" target="_blank">Our Values →</a>

*For those who want the complete picture, read <a href="https://worthchoosing.org/vivid-vision/" target="_blank">the full vision</a>.*
